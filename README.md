Project 1: Student Performance Prediction (Classification)

Google collab link- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x4lVuGS0gR77Pc-ZTC1fTEMVl65KTjAE?usp=sharing

Description:
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will pass or fail based on academic performance features such as grades G1, G2, and G3. A classification model (Logistic Regression) was used to make this prediction.

Data preprocessing involved stripping column name spaces, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Visualizations like count plots, box plots, and a correlation heatmap helped understand the relationships between features and outcomes. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.5%, with a recall of 100%, meaning it successfully identified all students who passed.



Project 2: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

Description:- 
This project aims to predict the price of houses using the Boston Housing Dataset. We selected key features such as the average number of rooms (RM), percentage of lower-status population (LSTAT), and pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO) to build a Linear Regression model. The goal was to understand the relationship between these features and house prices (MEDV) and evaluate the model's ability to predict housing prices accurately.

We performed data preprocessing by handling missing values, visualized feature distributions and correlations, and then split the data into training and testing sets. The model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately 31.45 and an RÂ² score of 0.63, indicating that it was able to explain about 63% of the variance in house prices.
